# Playwright + Cucumber Tests

![CI](https://github.com/Venkata271/frontend-automation-mcc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains Playwright tests driven by Cucumber. GitHub Actions runs the test suite and uploads test reports as artifacts.

Quick start — run locally:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm run test:report
```

Push to GitHub (replace `<owner>/<repo>`):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Option A: create and push using gh CLI
gh repo create Venkata271/frontend-automation-mcc --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
# Option B: manual
git remote add origin https://github.com/Venkata271/frontend-automation-mcc.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Viewing reports
- GitHub Actions artifacts: open the workflow run and download `test-reports` artifact.
- Local HTML report: `reports/cucumber-report.html` (generated by `npm run report`).

Repository secrets (optional)
- Set any credentials or tokens required for tests under repository Settings → Secrets.
